# my-hackerrank-solutions

These are (one of the many)solutions to some of the challenges on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) written in Python 2. They're completely open sources meaning, if you find bugs, flaws or better versions of them please do a pull request and I'll be more than happy to verify and merge them.
Thank you :-)
